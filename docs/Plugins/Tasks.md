# Tasks in Fluent Search

Fluent Search offers a powerful feature called **Tasks**, enabling users to **extend and automate** its functionality without extensive programming knowledge. By chaining triggers and operations, you can create custom workflows that enhance productivity and streamline repetitive tasks.

## What Are Tasks?

**Tasks** in Fluent Search are user-defined sequences that automate various actions within the application. They consist of **triggers** and **operations**:

- **Trigger**: An event that initiates the task (e.g., a specific keyword entered in the search bar).
- **Operation**: An action performed in response to the trigger (e.g., opening a file, executing a command).

By combining these elements, you can automate complex workflows to suit your specific needs.

## Importing Task Projects

The Fluent Search community has shared numerous Task projects to boost productivity. To import a Task into your Fluent Search setup:

1. **Download the `.yaml` file**: Visit the [Fluent Search Tasks repository](https://github.com/adirh3/Fluent-Search-Tasks) and choose a Task project that fits your requirements.
2. **Import into Fluent Search**: Drag and drop the downloaded `.yaml` file into the Fluent Search Tasks window.

Once imported, the Task becomes available for use and customization within your Fluent Search environment.

## Creating Custom Tasks

Designing your own Tasks allows you to tailor Fluent Search to your workflow. Here's how to create a custom Task:

1. **Access the Tasks Window**: Open Fluent Search and navigate to the Tasks section.
2. **Define a New Task**: Click on "Create New Task" and provide a name and description.
3. **Set Up Triggers**: Specify what will initiate the Task (e.g., entering a particular keyword).
4. **Add Operations**: Determine the actions that will occur when the Task is triggered.
5. **Save and Test**: After configuring, save the Task and test it to ensure it functions as intended.

This process enables you to automate frequent actions, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.

## Understanding Operations

In the context of Fluent Search Tasks, an **Operation** is a discrete action that the application can perform. Operations can range from opening applications and files to executing scripts or sending keystrokes. Each operation can be configured with specific parameters and can produce outputs that feed into subsequent operations, allowing for complex and dynamic workflows.

## Contributing to the Community
