The **Browser** search app in Fluent Search enhances your productivity by providing seamless access to your browser's bookmarks, history, and search engines directly from the Fluent Search interface. It automatically detects profiles from Chromium-based browsers and Firefox, allowing you to search across all your browsing data efficiently.

### Automatic Detection and Indexing

Upon installation, Fluent Search scans your system for supported web browsers and their profiles. Once detected, it indexes bookmarks and browsing history, enabling quick searches without the need to open the browser.

#### Supported Browsers

- **Chromium-Based Browsers**: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and others.

- **Mozilla Firefox**: All profiles associated with Firefox installations.

### Searching Bookmarks and History

To search through your bookmarks and browsing history:

1. **Activate Fluent Search**:
    - Press `Ctrl + Alt` to open the Fluent Search interface.

2. **Enter Your Query**:
    - Type keywords related to the desired bookmark or previously visited page.

3. **View Results**:
    - Matching bookmarks and history entries will appear in the search results.
    - Select the desired result to open it in your default browser.

### Profile Management

Fluent Search allows you to manage which browser profiles are included in the search index.

#### Enabling or Disabling Profiles

1. **Open Settings**:
    - Activate Fluent Search (`Ctrl + Alt`).
    - Type `settings` and select the **Settings** option.

2. **Navigate to Browser Settings**:
    - In the Settings window, go to `Apps` > `Browser` > `Profiles`.

3. **Manage Profiles**:
    - A list of detected browser profiles will be displayed.
    - Use the toggle switch next to each profile to enable or disable it.

#### Adding Profiles Manually

If a profile isn't detected automatically, you can add it manually:

1. **In the Profiles Section**:
    - Click the `Add Profile` button.

2. **Enter Profile Details**:
    - **Browser Type**: Select the browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
    - **Profile Name**: Assign a name to the profile.
    - **Profile Path**: Specify the path to the profile directory.

3. **Save the Profile**:
    - Click `Save` to include the new profile in the search index.

### Automatic Search Tag Creation

Fluent Search enhances search efficiency by automatically generating search tags based on your browsing habits.

#### How It Works

- **Usage Analysis**: The application monitors your frequent searches and website visits.

- **Tag Generation**: When a pattern is identified (e.g., frequent searches on Amazon), Fluent Search creates a corresponding tag (e.g., `amazon`).

#### Using Automatic Tags

1. **Invoke Fluent Search**:
    - Press `Ctrl + Alt`.

2. **Enter the Tag**:
    - Type the generated tag (e.g., `amazon`) followed by your search query.

3. **Execute the Search**:
    - Press `Enter` to perform the search directly on the associated website.

This feature streamlines the process of conducting site-specific searches without manually navigating to the website.

By leveraging the Browser search app in Fluent Search, you can efficiently access and manage your bookmarks, browsing history, and streamline your web search experience through intelligent tag generation and profile management.
