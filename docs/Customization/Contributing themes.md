Fluent Search offers a vibrant theming system, allowing users to personalize their experience and share their creations with the community. By contributing your custom themes, you can help others enhance their Fluent Search interface.

### Creating and Sharing Custom Themes

1. **Designing Your Theme**:
    - Within Fluent Search, navigate to `Settings` > `Personalization` > `Themes`.
    - Customize colors, window styles, text preferences, and effects to craft your unique theme.
    - Save your theme locally once you're satisfied with the design.

2. **Preparing for Submission**:
    - Ensure your theme file is properly named and includes any necessary resources, such as images or specific configurations.
    - Consider adding a preview image to showcase your theme to potential users.

3. **Submitting Your Theme to GitHub**:
    - Visit the [Fluent Search Themes Repository](https://github.com/adirh3/Fluent-Search-Themes) on GitHub.
    - Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
    - Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    - Create a new folder within the repository for your theme, and add your theme files and preview image.
    - Commit your changes with a descriptive message about your theme.
    - Push the changes to your forked repository.
    - On GitHub, navigate to the original Fluent Search Themes Repository and initiate a Pull Request (PR) from your fork, providing details about your theme and its features.

Once your Pull Request is reviewed and merged, your theme will become part of the community collection, accessible to all Fluent Search users.
