Fluent Search's **Screen Search** feature empowers users to navigate and interact with their computer entirely through keyboard inputs, minimizing reliance on the mouse. By overlaying labels on clickable areas of the screen, users can select and activate these elements by typing the corresponding letters.

### Activating Screen Search

- **Default Shortcut**: Press `Ctrl + M` to initiate Screen Search.

Upon activation, labels will appear on interactive elements, allowing you to type the displayed letters to select and engage with the desired item.

### Screen Search Engines

Fluent Search offers two distinct engines to identify clickable elements:

1. **Image Recognition**:
    - **Functionality**: Captures a screenshot and analyzes it to detect interactive components.
    - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications lacking accessibility data or when visual elements are predominant.

2. **In-Window Content**:
    - **Functionality**: Utilizes Windows' screen reader capabilities to identify clickable items within the active window.
    - **Use Case**: Best suited for standard applications with accessible UI elements.

By default, Fluent Search operates in **Auto** mode, intelligently selecting the most appropriate engine based on the current context.

### Configuring Screen Search Settings

To customize Screen Search behavior:

1. **Open Settings**:
    - Activate Fluent Search (`Ctrl + Alt`).
    - Type `settings` and press `Enter`.

2. **Navigate to Screen Search Settings**:
    - In the Settings menu, select `Screen` > `Screen Search`.

3. **Adjust Engine Preferences**:
    - **Engine Mode**: Choose between `Auto`, `Image Recognition`, or `In-Window Content` based on your preference.
    - **Shortcut Configuration**: Modify the activation shortcut if desired.

By tailoring these settings, you can optimize Screen Search to align with your workflow, enhancing efficiency and reducing dependence on mouse navigation.
