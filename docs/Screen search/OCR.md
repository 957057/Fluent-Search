## Enhancing Screen Search with OCR in Fluent Search

Fluent Search's **Screen Search** feature is designed to help you navigate your computer seamlessly using just your keyboard. To further enhance this experience, Fluent Search integrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR), allowing you to search and interact with on-screen text that isn't typically selectable.

### What is OCR in Screen Search?

OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. In the context of Fluent Search, it enables the system to recognize and extract text from images or areas of the screen, making even non-interactive text searchable and actionable. This is particularly useful for accessing text within images, videos, or applications where text selection is not possible.

### Using OCR with Screen Search

To utilize OCR within Screen Search:

1. **Activate Screen Search**:
    - Press `Ctrl + M` to initiate Screen Search.

2. **Search On-Screen Text**:
    - Type your query prefixed with the `Screen` tag (e.g., `Screen: your search term`).
    - Fluent Search will process the visible screen content, extracting and matching text based on your query.

### Configuring OCR Settings

To tailor the OCR functionality to your needs:

1. **Access OCR Settings**:
    - Press `Ctrl + Alt` to open Fluent Search.
    - Type `settings` and press `Enter`.
    - Navigate to `Screen` > `OCR`.

2. **Set Default OCR Language**:
    - Choose your preferred language for text recognition. This ensures that OCR processes text accurately based on the selected language.

3. **Enable OCR Language Tags**:
    - If you work with multiple languages, you can enable the "Add OCR language tags" option. This allows you to specify the language for a particular search by using language-specific tags (e.g., `Screen:fr: votre terme de recherche` for French).

By configuring these settings, Fluent Search's OCR feature becomes a powerful tool, enabling you to interact with and search through all visible text on your screen, thereby enhancing your productivity and accessibility.
