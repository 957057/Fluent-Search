## Advanced Usage of Screen Search in Fluent Search

Fluent Search's **Screen Search** feature offers advanced functionalities that enable users to navigate and interact with their computer entirely through keyboard inputs, reducing reliance on the mouse. By utilizing various key commands, users can perform different types of clicks, adjust label positions, switch search engines, and manage multi-monitor setups efficiently.

### Performing Click Actions with Key Commands

Screen Search allows users to execute specific mouse actions by pressing designated keys before typing the label text associated with an on-screen element. These actions can be customized in the settings. The default key commands are:

- **Single Click**: Press the label text directly to perform a standard click.

- **Double Click**: Press `2`, then type the label text.

- **Text Selection**: Press `3`, then type the label text to initiate text selection mode.

- **Right Click**: Press `4`, then type the label text.

- **Mouse Movement**: Press `5`, then type the label text to move the cursor to the element without clicking.

These key commands provide a versatile approach to interacting with various on-screen elements directly from the keyboard.

### Navigating and Adjusting Labels

While Screen Search is active, users can fine-tune the positioning of labels to better align with undetected or misaligned items:

- **Arrow Keys**: Pressing the arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) will adjust the position of the selected label, allowing precise alignment with the desired on-screen element.

This functionality ensures that all interactive components are accessible, even if they are not initially detected or perfectly aligned.

### Switching Between Search Engines

Fluent Search incorporates two primary engines for detecting clickable elements:

1. **Image Recognition**: Analyzes a screenshot to identify interactive components.

2. **In-Window Content**: Utilizes Windows' screen reader capabilities to detect clickable items within the active window.

By default, Fluent Search operates in **Auto** mode, selecting the most appropriate engine based on context. Users can manually switch between these engines while Screen Search is active:

- **Press `Tab`**: Toggles between Image Recognition and In-Window Content modes, allowing users to choose the engine that best suits their current task.

This flexibility ensures optimal detection of interactive elements across various applications and interfaces.

### Managing Multi-Monitor Setups

For users with multiple monitors, Screen Search offers functionality to navigate between screens seamlessly:

- **Right Shift Key**: Pressing the right `Shift` key moves the Screen Search focus to the monitor positioned to the right.

- **Left Shift Key**: Pressing the left `Shift` key moves the focus to the monitor on the left.

This feature facilitates efficient management of multi-monitor environments, enabling users to control and interact with applications across all screens using keyboard inputs alone.

By mastering these advanced functionalities, users can fully harness the power of Fluent Search's Screen Search feature, achieving a highly efficient and mouse-free computing experience.
