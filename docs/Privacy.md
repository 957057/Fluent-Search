## Fluent Search Privacy Policy

Hi there! I'm Adir, the developer behind Fluent Search. I started this project as a hobby to make navigating your computer a more seamless experience. While it's a personal passion project, I take your privacy very seriously. I want to be completely transparent about how Fluent Search works with your data.

### 1\. Data Collection and User Activity Logging

Fluent Search **does not collect** any of your personal data or log your activity. Every search you perform and every interaction you have with the app happens entirely on your own computer. There are no hidden trackers, no analytics gathering your information—nothing leaves your device.  
**The only exceptions are basic telemetry when you open the app and crash diagnostics data; these do not contain any personal information and are used solely to improve the app's performance and stability.**

### 2\. Data Storage

All data processed by Fluent Search is stored **locally on your machine**. The app doesn't transmit any information externally. There's no cloud storage, no external servers, and no hidden data transfers. Your searches and data stay with you, exactly where they belong.

To give you a clear picture of where Fluent Search stores its data, here's how it works:

#### Settings Storage:

*   **Installer Version:** Settings are saved in the App Data folder called **Blast**.
*   **Appx/Microsoft Store Version:** Settings are stored in a containerized App Data folder named **Blast**.
*   **Portable Version:** Settings are kept in a folder next to the executable, also called **Blast**.

#### Indexer Storage:

*   **Installer Version:** Indexed data is stored in the Program Data folder named **Fluent Search**. This folder can be accessed only by an administrator, adding an extra layer of security.
*   **Appx/Microsoft Store Version:** Indexed data is stored in the Program Data folder named **Fluent Search**, also accessible only by an administrator.
*   **Portable Version:** Indexed data is stored in a folder next to the executable called **Cache**.

### 3\. Access to Data

Since I'm the sole developer and Fluent Search doesn't send data anywhere, **no one else** has access to your information—not even me. The app doesn't integrate with any third-party services that could access your data. Your privacy is entirely in your hands.

Please note that some optional plugins may use third-party services, like Translator or Microsoft To Do. These plugins are disabled by default, and you can choose whether to enable them based on your preferences.

### 4\. Data Retention

Because Fluent Search doesn't collect or store personal data beyond what's necessary for it to function on your device, there's no data retention policy needed. Any temporary data the app uses is handled by your system and is kept only as long as needed for the app to run smoothly.

### 5\. User Control Over Data Collection

You have **full control** over how Fluent Search operates. While the app doesn't collect data, you can adjust settings within the app to disable any features you're not comfortable with, including crash diagnostics. To stop sending crash reports, simply disable the **"Send crash diagnostics"** option in Settings.

Rest assured, there are no hidden agendas—just a simple, efficient tool designed to make your life a bit easier.

If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always here to help and eager to improve Fluent Search based on your feedback. After all, this app is for you, and your insights make a world of difference.

By the way, if there's anything specific you'd like to see in future updates or if you have ideas on how Fluent Search can serve you better, I'm all ears. Your thoughts not only help enhance the app but also make this hobby project even more rewarding.
