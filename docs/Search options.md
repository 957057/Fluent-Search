Fluent Search offers a **highly customizable search experience**, allowing users to fine-tune how results are displayed, grouped, and prioritized. By adjusting these settings, you can **speed up search, improve relevance, and control interactions**.

### Fuzzy Search

Fuzzy Search is **enabled by default** and helps find results even when there are **minor typos or missing characters**. It works **only when typing without spaces**. If you want stricter matching, you can disable it in **Settings > Search > Experience**.

### Search Shortcuts

Search shortcuts allow you to **map specific input to a predefined search query**. This reduces typing effort for frequently used searches.

Example:
- Typing **`mcd`** can be mapped to **`my cool document`**, instantly searching long terms.

To configure shortcuts:
1. **Go to `Settings > Search > Experience > Search mappings`**.
2. **Create a new shortcut** by assigning an input phrase and the corresponding search command.

### Results Grouping

Grouping results makes it easier to navigate search results. Fluent Search provides **three grouping modes**:

- **By Type**: Groups results based on file type (e.g., applications, files, web pages).
- **By Related App**: Groups results based on the application that generated them.
- **Smart Grouping**: Uses an intelligent algorithm to automatically organize results in the most relevant way.

To enable or change grouping:
1. **Open `Settings > Search > Results > Group search results`**.
2. **Select the preferred grouping method**.

### Disabling Delete Features

By default, Fluent Search **allows deleting files and other items** directly from search results. If you prefer a safer search experience, you can **disable deletion features**.

To do this:
1. **Go to `Settings > Search > Results`**.
2. **Toggle off the delete options**.

This ensures no accidental deletions occur while using Fluent Search.

### Instant Search

Instant Search allows Fluent Search to **start searching automatically** without pressing a hotkey. This is particularly useful for **file dialogs or specific applications**.

#### How It Works:
- **Triggers search automatically** when a supported application or process is focused.
- **Configurable per process**‚Äîyou can set different rules for different apps.
- **Prevents search activation** if the focused control is a text area (e.g., when typing in a document or chatbox).

#### Configuring Instant Search:
1. **Go to `Settings > Search > Instant Search`**.
2. **Enable or disable Instant Search**.
3. **Define specific processes** where Instant Search should be active.
4. **Choose which search tags should apply for each process** (e.g., files only when inside a file explorer).

### Prioritizing Search Results

Fluent Search allows users to **set rules for prioritizing certain results**. This helps control **which results appear first**, making searches faster and more relevant.

#### How Prioritization Works:
- You can set rules to **prioritize results** based on:
    - **Name** (e.g., results starting with ‚ÄúProject‚Äù appear first).
    - **Context** (e.g., prefer files from a specific folder).
    - **Tags** (e.g., prioritize ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù over ‚Äúimages‚Äù).
    - **Search App** (e.g., prioritize results from Files over Web).

#### Configuring Prioritization:
1. **Go to `Settings > Search > Prioritization`**.
2. **Add new rules** to define how results should be ranked.
3. **Use wildcards, ‚Äústarts with,‚Äù or exact matches** for more control.

Additionally, you can manually sort results using the **order icon in the bottom left of the search window**. Click this icon to **sort results by name, type, modified date, etc.**
